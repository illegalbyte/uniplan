# UniPlan Design Documentation
This document is an ongoing record of my design process (mistakes and all) – here I will jot down all my thoughts, considerations, and processes for designing uniplan. Let's start with functionality requirements, shall we?

## Functionality Requirements

- [ ] Ability to track units enrolled in 
- [ ] Plan future unit enrollments (coursemap) and have this validated against Deakin University unit guides (eg warn me if a unit is only available in semester 2 etc)
- [ ] Deploy using AWS – include some sort of serverless functionality
- [ ] Implement an accounts and login system utilising Django Auth (this tool should be able to benefit others)
- [ ] Track unit grades (High Distinction, etc)
- [ ] Measure and track assignment performance, assessment weightings, throughout the semester 
- [ ] Able to handle complexity: hurdle tasks
- [ ] Have a dashboard which displays your WAM
- [ ] Design using React and Boostrap (limit efforts invested in manually writing CSS)
- [ ] 


## Database design

Use Draw.io file 'schema.drawio'
